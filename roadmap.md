# 🌌 STARWEAVE: Roadmap

## Project Overview

STARWEAVE is an advanced pattern recognition engine that combines Elixir's distributed processing capabilities with Python's machine learning ecosystem, designed to explore the boundaries of artificial general intelligence through a distributed, energy-pattern based approach.

## 🌟 Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

- [x] After completion of Phase 1, we should be able to run the system and see a basic web interface to interact with the pattern engine and LLM. We will mark this phase complete when we can run the system and see a basic web interface to interact with the pattern engine and LLM, getting reasonable responses from the STARWEAVE enhanced LLM.

### Core Infrastructure
- [x] Set up Elixir umbrella project structure
- [x] Configure Phoenix web interface with LiveView
- [x] Implement basic real-time communication channels
- [x] Set up Python environment and gRPC bridge
  - Note: Elixir client currently aggregates streaming via unary-per-item fallback for test stability; Python server supports true bidi streaming. We can re-enable client streaming after test adjustments.

### Basic Pattern Engine
- [x] Design energy-based pattern data structures
  - Implemented `StarweaveCore.Pattern` with `id`, `data`, `metadata`, `energy`, `inserted_at`.
- [x] Implement basic pattern matching algorithms
  - Added `StarweaveCore.PatternMatcher` with `:exact`, `:contains`, and `:jaccard` strategies.
- [x] Create pattern storage and retrieval system
  - ETS-backed `StarweaveCore.PatternStore` (GenServer) with add/get/all/clear; supervised.
- [x] Set up basic testing framework
  - Core tests added for store and matching; green under `mix test`.

### LLM Integration
- [x] Integrate Ollama LLM with basic text generation
- [x] Create LLM adapter pattern for multiple providers
- [x] Implement streaming response handling
