# Starweave Core

Core components and intelligence framework for the STARWEAVE project, a distributed, pattern-aware cognitive architecture.

## Overview

Starweave Core provides the foundational components for a distributed cognitive system that processes patterns, maintains working memory, and enables intelligent behavior through various reasoning and learning mechanisms.

## Core Components

### 1. Distributed System

- **Node Discovery**: Manages cluster membership and node communication
- **Task Distribution**: Distributes computational tasks across the cluster
- **Fault Tolerance**: Implements task recovery and checkpointing
- **Supervision**: Hierarchical supervision tree for distributed processes

### 2. Intelligence Layer

- **Working Memory**: Maintains the system's short-term memory state
- **Pattern Learning**: Identifies and learns from patterns in data
- **Attention Mechanism**: Manages focus and resource allocation
- **Goal Management**: Handles goal setting and achievement
- **Reasoning Engine**: Performs logical inference and decision making
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Implements learning from feedback
- **Memory Persistence**: Handles persistence of memory states

### 3. Pattern Processing

- **Pattern Matching**: Core pattern recognition and matching
- **Temporal Patterns**: Handles time-based pattern recognition
- **Pattern Evolution**: Manages how patterns change over time
- **Pattern Resonance**: Implements pattern activation and spreading activation
- **Visualization**: Tools for visualizing patterns and system state

## Installation

Add `starweave_core` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:starweave_core, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

```elixir
# Start the application
Application.ensure_all_started(:starweave_core)

# Example: Store and retrieve from working memory
:ok = StarweaveCore.WorkingMemory.store(:test_key, %{data: "example"})
{:ok, value} = StarweaveCore.WorkingMemory.retrieve(:test_key)
```

## Monitoring

The system includes a web-based dashboard for monitoring the working memory and system state, available at `/ets-dashboard` when the web interface is running.
