### Local LLM Model Selection: Balancing Performance & Intelligence

This document outlines a strategy for selecting and implementing local Large Language Models (LLMs) on consumer-grade hardware, particularly when designing a system that requires both fast, reactive responses and deep, complex reasoning. The approach is analogous to how humans and teams manage cognitive resources, using different modes of thinking for different types of problems.

### The Core Challenge: VRAM as a Bottleneck

The primary constraint for running local LLMs is **VRAM (Video RAM)**. A model's "intelligence" is directly correlated with its size (number of parameters), and larger models require more VRAM.

* **FP16 Models:** A 30B parameter model requires ~60GB of VRAM, which is beyond the capacity of most consumer GPUs.
* **Quantization:** A model compression technique that reduces its size by converting high-precision parameters (e.g., 16-bit floats) to lower-precision integers (e.g., 4-bit). This allows larger models to fit into smaller VRAM footprints with minimal loss of quality.
    * **30B Model (Q4 Quantization):** Requires approximately 17GB of VRAM, making it a perfect fit for GPUs with 24GB of VRAM (like the AMD RX 7900 XTX).

### The Proposed System: A Hybrid, Distributed Architecture

To overcome the VRAM bottleneck and provide a seamless user experience, a hybrid, distributed system is proposed. This system leverages multiple models of different sizes, each optimized for a specific type of task.

* **Primary Node:** The central hub that routes all incoming requests.
* **Worker Nodes:** Individual machines (e.g., a user's PC) that run one or more LLMs.

The system intelligently routes tasks based on their complexity.

| Model Size | Function | Requirements | Human Parallel |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **7B - 13B** | **Reactive & Fast** | Lower VRAM (8-16GB). Suitable for quick, general-purpose queries and conversational chat. | **System 1 Thinking:** Fast, intuitive, and automatic. Used for routine tasks that require little effort. |
| **30B** | **Complex & Intelligent** | High VRAM (24GB+). The "sweet spot" for most reasoning tasks, coding, and in-depth conversation. | **System 2 Thinking:** Slow, deliberate, and effortful. Engaged for complex problems that require focus and analysis. |
| **70B+** | **Agentic & Expert** | Requires significant VRAM (48GB+) or heavy offloading to system RAM. Used for long-running, "black box" tasks like complex coding projects. | **A State of Flow:** Deep, uninterrupted focus on a single, resource-intensive task, during which other mental processes are temporarily blocked. |

### New Architecture: Multi-Model Augmentation for Complex Tasks

A more advanced, agentic architecture can be implemented to address the performance trade-off of using a single large model for all tasks. This system, known as a **multi-model augmentation** or "plan-and-execute" framework, uses a hierarchy of models for different cognitive roles.

* **The "Planner" (70B Model):** This role is delegated to the largest, most capable model. Its purpose is to perform high-level reasoning and create a detailed, step-by-step "game plan" for complex tasks, such as solving a coding problem or completing a long-running project. Instead of doing all the work, its superior intelligence is used to break down a vague request into a sequence of smaller, manageable actions. It can be prompted to output a structured plan, which is a relatively quick task compared to writing the code or text itself. This leverages the 70B model's strength in strategic planning and reasoning.

* **The "Executor" (30B Model):** This role is assigned to the smaller, faster model. The 30B model follows the clear, well-reasoned instructions from the 70B model's plan. Because the steps are modular and atomic (e.g., "create file `X`," "add function `Y` to `Z`"), the 30B model can execute them quickly and efficiently. This process can be much faster overall because the heavy computation is limited to the initial planning phase.

| Model Role | Task Type | Key Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Planner (70B)** | High-level reasoning, task decomposition, strategic planning | Uses superior intelligence to avoid errors and create an optimal workflow. |
| **Executor (30B)** | Code generation, refactoring, writing, and other single-step actions | Uses blazing-fast speed to complete tasks quickly, making the overall workflow much more efficient. |

### The Human Parallels

The design of this system can be understood through analogies to human cognitive processes and social organization.

1.  **Individual Cognition:** A single human mind, with its limited working memory and processing capacity, functions like a single AI node. It uses **System 1 thinking** for instant reactions and **System 2 thinking** for deep, deliberate work, which consumes a significant portion of its cognitive resources.

2.  **Distributed Cognition & Teamwork:** A large-scale project is often too complex for a single person to manage. Instead, a team divides the labor, with each member specializing in a certain area and contributing to a shared, collective knowledge base. This mirrors the distributed AI system, where:
    * **Task Distribution:** Complex projects are routed to "expert" worker nodes (e.g., the 70B model) that specialize in deep reasoning.
    * **Specialization:** Different models are used for different purposes, just as different team members have different areas of expertise.
    * **Collective Knowledge:** The system's ability to pull from a shared knowledge base (e.g., a codebase or file system) mirrors a team's use of external memory and documentation.

By combining fast, responsive models for general tasks with a powerful, dedicated model for complex projects, the system achieves a level of performance, reliability, and capability that would be impossible with a single model.
