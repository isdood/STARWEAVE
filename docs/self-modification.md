# STARWEAVE Self-Modification System

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture and implementation plan for STARWEAVE's self-modification capabilities, enabling the system to safely modify its own codebase in response to feedback and changing requirements.

## A Simpler Path: The Unified `open-swe` Agent

Instead of combining several large systems, focus on building **one core agent** that handles the entire software modification lifecycle. This agent would replicate the core logic of projects like `open-swe`, which typically follows a **plan -> retrieve -> edit -> test** loop. This approach reduces initial overhead and allows you to build a solid foundation before adding complexity.


### **Phase 1: Build the Core Agent (2-3 weeks)**

The goal of this phase is to create a minimum viable product that can take a specific task, apply a code change, and verify it. This combines the most critical functions of all the proposed tools into one manageable system.

1.  **Establish the Agent Framework**:
    * Use a framework like [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) to define the agent's reasoning loop. This will be the "brain" that orchestrates the entire process.
    * **Replaces**: The high-level orchestration role of **OpenDevin**.

2.  **Implement Basic Code Understanding (RAG)**:
    * Create a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The agent needs to be able to search the STARWEAVE codebase to find relevant files and functions based on the task description.
    * Start with basic vector search on the code.
    * **Replaces**: The initial need for **SWE-Kit**.

3.  **Develop a Simple Code Editing Tool**:
    * Give the agent the ability to read a file, propose changes (e.g., as a patch file or by specifying line numbers to modify), and write the changes back to the file within a safe, sandboxed environment.
    * **Replaces**: The complex Git-aware features of **Aider**.

4.  **Integrate Testing and Verification**:
    * The agent's final step should be to run the project's existing test suite (e.g., `pytest`, `npm test`) within the sandbox. If the tests pass, the change is considered successful.
    * This is a critical safety and validation step.

### **Phase 2: Incremental Enhancement (2-3 weeks)**

Once the core agent is functional, you can layer in more advanced capabilities inspired by the specialized tools, but as **native features of your agent** rather than new dependencies.

1.  **Improve Context & Planning**:
    * Enhance the RAG system with more sophisticated retrieval techniques (e.g., using an Abstract Syntax Tree to understand code structure), moving closer to **SWE-Kit's** capabilities.
    * Improve the agent's planning step to break down more complex tasks.

2.  **Automate Git Workflow**:
    * Give the agent the ability to create new branches, commit its changes with descriptive messages, and open pull requests. This incorporates the core functionality of **Aider**.

3.  **Automate Task Ingestion**:
    * Connect the agent to your issue tracker (e.g., GitHub Issues). Allow it to parse an issue and automatically formulate a plan to solve it, which is the main function of **AutoCodeRover**.

## Benefits of This Simplified Approach

* **Reduced Complexity**: You manage the development of a single, coherent agent rather than integrating and maintaining four separate, complex systems.
* **Faster Initial Results**: You can have a working end-to-end prototype much faster, which provides immediate value and allows for quicker iteration.
* **Greater Flexibility**: It's easier to modify or swap out components (like the LLM, the retrieval method, or the testing strategy) within your own agent than it is to reconfigure a third-party dependency.
* **Focused Development**: This approach centers your efforts on building the core intelligence for self-modification, rather than getting bogged down in systems integration.
