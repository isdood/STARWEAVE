# STARWEAVE Fine-Tuning Strategy

## 1. Research Objectives

This document outlines our approach to researching and implementing fine-tuning for the Language Models (LLMs) used within the STARWEAVE ecosystem. Our primary goals are to:

- **Enhance Domain Understanding**: Improve the model's comprehension of pattern recognition, cognitive architectures, and distributed systems concepts central to STARWEAVE.
- **Optimize Performance**: Reduce prompt engineering overhead and improve response quality for common queries.
- **Increase Efficiency**: Potentially reduce context window requirements and computational costs for frequent operations.
- **Improve Consistency**: Ensure more predictable and structured outputs that align with STARWEAVE's architecture.

## 2. Benefits of Fine-Tuning

Investing in fine-tuning will provide several key advantages:

### Technical Benefits
- **Reduced Prompt Engineering**: Less need for complex prompt templates as domain knowledge gets baked into the model.
- **Faster Inference**: Fine-tuned models often require fewer tokens to achieve the same results.
- **Better Context Utilization**: More efficient use of context windows for complex reasoning tasks.

### User Experience Improvements
- More accurate and relevant responses to domain-specific queries
- Reduced latency for common operations
- More natural interaction patterns

### System Benefits
- Lower computational costs through more efficient processing
- Better resource utilization in distributed environments
- More consistent behavior across different deployment scenarios

## 3. Data Requirements

### Data Collection Strategy

We will focus on collecting and generating high-quality, domain-specific examples including:

1. **Pattern Recognition Scenarios**
   - Examples of pattern detection and analysis
   - Pattern evolution and transformation cases
   - Edge cases in pattern matching

2. **System Interactions**
   - Common user queries and ideal responses
   - Debugging and troubleshooting scenarios
   - System configuration and optimization queries

3. **Code Understanding**
   - Code explanation examples
   - API documentation and usage patterns
   - Common programming patterns in Elixir/OTP

4. **Memory and Context Management**
   - Context retention and retrieval examples
   - Multi-turn conversation patterns
   - Knowledge integration scenarios

### Data Quality Guidelines
- Each example should be clear, concise, and unambiguous
- Include diverse phrasings and approaches
- Cover both common and edge cases
- Ensure proper formatting and structure
