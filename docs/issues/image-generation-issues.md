## Image Generation Issues

### Notes
1) ROCm is not working yet - I think it's related to my Arch Linux setup though, not due to the project itself
2) In terms of the proposed "persistent existence" system - It'd be interesting to enable STARWEAVE to test it's own image generation in the background, learning how to best utilize it's image generation model. While the current model is not the best, STARWEAVE could learn to enhance/manipulate user prompts to generate the best possible images
3) STARWEAVE can generate images from text prompts, but it can't generate text from images yet. STARWEAVE needs to be able to process images and generate text descriptions of them as well
4) Need to now integrate with the existing web interface
