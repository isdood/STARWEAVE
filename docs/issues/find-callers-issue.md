# Issue: find_callers/2 Function Not Correctly Identifying Callers

## Problem Statement
The `find_callers/2` function in `StarweaveLlm.SelfKnowledge.CodeCrossReferencer` is not correctly identifying callers of a specified function in the code graph. The function is expected to return a list of all functions that call a given target function.

## Current Behavior
- The function is returning an empty list when it should find callers
- The test case that verifies this functionality is failing with the message: "Expected at least one caller, got none"
- Debug output shows the function is having trouble finding the target function in the graph

## What We've Tried

### 1. Graph Structure Verification
- Verified that the test graph is correctly constructed with:
  - Vertices for both the caller ("User.create/2") and callee ("String.contains?/2")
  - An edge connecting them with appropriate metadata
- Confirmed that the graph structure is correctly set up with `:digraph` functions

### 2. Function Name Format
- Initially tried with full function name ("String.contains?/2")
- Switched to just the function name with arity ("contains?/2") based on graph vertex format
- Verified the exact string matching requirements for function names

### 3. Graph Reference Handling
- Tried passing different graph reference formats:
  - Raw digraph reference
  - Tuple-wrapped digraph reference
  - KnowledgeBase GenServer reference
- Added extensive debug logging to trace the graph reference handling

### 4. Debugging Output
Added detailed logging to track:
- Graph structure and contents
- Vertex lookups
- Edge traversals
- Function name parsing and matching

## Current Understanding

### Key Observations
1. The test graph is correctly constructed with the expected vertices and edges
2. The `find_function_vertex/2` helper is failing to find the target function vertex
3. There appears to be an issue with how the graph reference is being handled when looking up vertices
4. The error suggests a `:badrecord` error when trying to access the graph, indicating possible issues with the graph reference format

### Potential Issues
1. **Graph Reference Format**: The function might expect a different graph reference format than what's being passed
2. **Function Name Parsing**: The function name matching logic might not handle special characters (like '?') correctly
3. **Graph Traversal**: The edge traversal logic might not be correctly identifying call relationships

## Next Steps to Investigate

1. **Inspect Graph Reference Handling**: 
   - Verify the exact format expected by `:digraph` functions
   - Check if the graph reference needs to be reconstructed or wrapped differently

2. **Function Name Matching**:
   - Add more detailed logging of the function name matching process
   - Test with a simpler function name (without special characters) to isolate the issue

3. **Graph Traversal Logic**:
   - Verify the edge traversal logic in `find_callers/2`
   - Check if the edge metadata is being correctly interpreted

4. **Test Simplification**:
   - Create a minimal test case with the simplest possible graph
   - Gradually add complexity to identify the breaking point

## Additional Context

### Test Environment
- Elixir 1.18.4
- Erlang/OTP
- Using `:digraph` for graph operations

## Note on Complexity
This issue has proven more complex than initially anticipated. Despite multiple approaches to debug and fix the function, the root cause remains elusive. The problem likely involves subtle interactions between the graph structure, function name parsing, and reference handling that aren't immediately obvious from the code alone.

Future investigation might benefit from:
1. A fresh perspective on the problem
2. More detailed logging of the graph traversal process
3. Potentially restructuring the graph handling code for better debuggability
