# Distributed System Issues - Status Report

## Current Configuration
- Both nodes are running Endeavour OS and have installed Elixir/Erlang through the Paru AUR wrapper for pacman.

### Main Node
- **IP Address**: 192.168.0.47
- **HTTP Port**: 4000 (confirmed open and accessible)
- **Distribution Port**: 9000 (confirmed open via netcat)
- **Firewall**: firewalld (ports 4000 and 9000 are open)

### Worker Node
- **IP Address**: 192.168.0.49
- **Distribution Port**: 9100-9110
- **Firewall**: firewalld (ports 9100-9110 are open)
- **Erlang Cookie**: starweave-cookie (matches main node)

## Current Issue

### Error Details
When starting the worker node, it fails with the following error:
```
=SUPERVISOR REPORT====
    supervisor: {local,net_sup}
    errorContext: start_error
    reason: {'EXIT',
            {undef,
                [{'Elixir.IEx.EPMD.Client',start_link,[],[]},
                 ...
                 {gen_server,init_it,6,
                     [{file,"gen_server.erl"},{line,2236}]}]}}
```

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **EPMD Client Initialization Failure**: The worker node is unable to start the IEx.EPMD.Client process.
2. **Undefined Function**: The error suggests that the `start_link/0` function in the `IEx.EPMD.Client` module is undefined.
3. **Dependency Issue**: This typically indicates a version mismatch or missing dependency between Elixir/Erlang and the IEx application.

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Elixir/Erlang Versions**
   - Check that both nodes are running compatible versions of Elixir and Erlang
   - Run `elixir --version` and `erl` on both nodes

2. **Check IEx Application**
   - Verify that IEx is properly installed and available
   - Check for any version conflicts with IEx dependencies

3. **Temporary Workaround**
   - Try starting the worker node with `--no-halt` flag to prevent automatic connection attempts
   - Manually connect to the main node after startup using `Node.connect/1`

4. **Environment Variables**
   - Check for any conflicting environment variables
   - Ensure `ELIXIR_ERL_OPTIONS` is not set to conflicting values

## Error Logs
Full error logs have been captured in `erl_crash.dump` on the worker node.

## Network Status
- ✅ Main node HTTP port (4000) is accessible from worker
- ✅ Main node distribution port (9000) is accessible from worker
- ✅ Worker node can resolve main node's hostname
- ✅ Firewall rules appear to be correctly configured on both nodes
