# ðŸŒŒ STARWEAVE: A Distributed Cognitive Architecture for Pattern Intelligence

## Vision
STARWEAVE is an advanced cognitive architecture that explores the boundaries of artificial general intelligence through distributed, energy-pattern based computation. It combines Elixir's robust distributed processing with Python's machine learning ecosystem to create a system that evolves and learns in ways that more closely resemble biological intelligence.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Distributed Intelligence Layer
- **Node Discovery & Task Distribution**: Self-organizing cluster of processing nodes
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic recovery and task redistribution
- **Resource Optimization**: Dynamic allocation based on system load and priorities

### 2. Cognitive Components
- **Pattern Recognition Engine**: Real-time pattern detection and analysis
- **Working Memory**: ETS-based short-term memory with DETS persistence
- **LLM Integration**: Seamless Ollama integration for natural language understanding
- **Attention Mechanism**: Focus management and resource allocation

### 3. Theoretical Foundations
- **Resonance Theory**: Treating resonance as a fundamental dimension of reality
- **Energy-Pattern Processing**: Dynamic pattern evolution based on energy states
- **Self-Organizing Knowledge**: Autonomous structure formation and adaptation

## Key Features

### ðŸ§  Cognitive Capabilities
- Dynamic pattern recognition and evolution
- Context-aware memory systems
- Autonomous goal formation and pursuit
- Self-modifying architecture

### ðŸš€ Technical Highlights
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-millisecond pattern matching
- **Scalability**: Linear scaling with cluster size
- **Privacy-First**: Full local processing with optional cloud deployment
- **Visualization**: Real-time pattern and system state visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Elixir 1.14+ and Erlang/OTP 25+
- Python 3.9+ for ML components
- Ollama (for LLM capabilities)
- PostgreSQL (optional, for persistence)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/starweave.git
   cd STARWEAVE
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**
   ```bash
   # Install Elixir dependencies
   mix deps.get
   
   # Set up Python environment
   ./scripts/gRPC-init.sh
   ```

3. **Start the system**
   ```bash
   # Start the web interface
   cd apps/starweave_web
   OLLAMA_MODEL=your-preferred-model mix phx.server
   
   # In a new terminal, start the pattern server
   cd services/python
   source venv/bin/activate
   python -m server.pattern_server
   ```

4. **Access the dashboard**
   Open http://localhost:4000 in your browser
